# Databases-Phase-3
Repo for CS 3380 Final Project

# Build Instructions
Simply clone the repo in Visual Studio (or Rider like I used :D) and then make sure you have opened the Phase3Databases solution. Give the IDE a few seconds to make sure it restores all of the NuGet packages, and then simply run in the default configuration!
